##2.2) Data Dictionary
Create a data dictionary—using markdown syntax—in a separate text file: data-dictionary.md.
Include names of the variables, and a short description. Most of the variable names are
self-descriptive: e.g. team_name, game_date. However, depending on how much you know
about basketball, some variables may be a bit cryptic. So here’s a description for some of
them:
• period: an NBA game is divided in 4 periods of 12 mins each. For example, a value
for period = 1 refers to the first period (the first 12 mins of the game).
• minutes_remaining and seconds_remaining have to do with the amount of time in
minutes and seconds, respectively, that remained to be played in a given period.
• shot_made_flag indicates whether a shot was made (y) or missed (n).
• action_type has to do with the basketball moves used by players, either to pass by
defenders to gain access to the basket, or to get a clean pass to a teammate to score a
two pointer or three pointer.
• shot_type indicates whether a shot is a 2-point field goal, or a 3-point field goal.
• shot_distance: distance to the basket (measured in feet).
• x and y refer to the court coordinates (measured in inches) where a shot occurred .
